# hello-world


Hello! 

My name is Erik Mason. I am a student in Information Technology with a concentration in Cybersecurity. I have always enjoyed working with Python (mainly 3.x) but like to explore other languages to get a good understanding of what is out there and the strengths/weaknesses of languages. Mainly, everything published here on my hub will be Python based. 

Thank you for visiting!
